# Cool stuff I learned [1]

_03-05-2019 · 1 min read_

I’ve changed the post format to cover a larger period (not enough weekly). In the past weeks I worked with Rails, Docker and a bit of React — focusing on client + API architecture and reinforcing interview weaknesses.

## Rails

- `rails new project_name --api` — generates a Rails app adapted to be an API. Rails provides defaults so you can get up and running quickly; you can even enable API mode on an existing app. Familiarity + productivity make Rails my choice to learn more about APIs.

## Docker

- **Basics** — finally understood the value and started using it daily. You can package environment + dependencies and run almost anywhere. Great for developing on Windows 10 and making personal projects more accessible.

## React Native

- **Introduction** — impressed by how easy it is to create a mobile app with React and Expo. Excited to add it to my full-stack toolbelt. First app (to be improved): <https://github.com/ericmadureira/gym-app>

That’s all for the past few weeks — June is close and I feel like I’ve learned a lot already. :)
