# Review of Loiane Groner’s *Learning JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms*

This is a review of Loiane Groner’s *Learning JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms*. I will not make a huge analysis about every chapter but I hope this post can help you find an understandable reference about data structures.

This was the first data structure book I have read and I think it's an appropriate introduction to new programmers. Choosing JavaScript was a good decision: demand is high and the environment is very easy to set up — you can run code in most browser consoles. The book covers most of the basics and a little more than I’m used to seeing in articles: sets, hashing and a few paragraphs about algorithm complexity. Each chapter describes the concepts behind the data structure, its pros/cons and at least one detailed example.

Now a little criticism: page breaks sometimes make it harder to read and to keep track of code indentation. Also, maybe you should read another book that uses a language with pointers (like C/C++). It may improve your comprehension because JavaScript helps, but is not enough for that.

Parts I enjoyed the most (for solving doubts or presenting new concepts):

- variable scope — a true concern for those who want to master JavaScript
- truthy and falsy — a common source of misunderstanding
- linked lists vs conventional arrays — at least understand the differences
- decimal-to-binary converter using stacks — reminded me of first-semester CS classes
- hashing and hash table explanation — a new way of arranging data
- different sorting algorithms and their efficiencies (plus a small intro to Big-O)

The reading is worth it and I recommend it to anybody who is starting in programming or who misses a bit of computer science in their daily job/career.
