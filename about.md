Brazilian, Baiano and Web Developer. Iâ€™ve been working with Ruby on Rails daily on <a href="https://www.sisvida.com.br" target="_blank">sisvida.com.br</a> and have also been studying the modern Javascript enviroment, which includes Node and React.

My interests are Ruby on Rails, full stack development, career development and writing about them. Also I'm a huge fan of videogames, movies, science and well written stuff.

You can find some of my projects at <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github_username | cgi_escape | escape }}" title="{{ social.github | escape }}" target="_blank">Github</a>.
