Brazilian, Baiano and Software Developer. Iâ€™ve been working with Javascript (React, Redux, Node) on a daily basis at <a href="https://profusion.mobi/" target="_blank">ProFUSION</a>. Also used to code Ruby on Rails.

My interests are full stack development, career development and writing about them. Also I'm a huge fan of videogames, movies, science and well written stuff.

You can find some of my projects at <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github_username | cgi_escape | escape }}" title="{{ social.github | escape }}" target="_blank">Github</a>.
