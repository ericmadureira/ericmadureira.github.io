Every step in a developer’s career presents different challenges. I felt lucky to be in the right place with the minimum knowledge when, 3 years ago, I did my first tech interview and got my first job. It’s been a nice experience full of learning, especially when my mentor left and I felt unprepared for more responsibility. Everything turned out fine; I’m more confident and want to work with more talented people.

To reach this goal I plan on:

1. Reading more books (e.g., Jeff Sutherland’s _Scrum Guide_) to learn from the best, work on weaknesses and get ready for high-performance teams.
2. Taking more job interviews to feel more confident talking and taking tests.
3. Creating a series of MVPs throughout the year to practice industry-standard code.

Soon I’ll post more about how it developed.
