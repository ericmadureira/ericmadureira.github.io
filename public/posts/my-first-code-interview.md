I took my first code interview yesterday and, even not feeling 100% confident about the result, it was a good experience. For my first/current job there wasn’t an extensive test — just a quick portfolio review.

I had 1 hour to solve ~7 questions while being watched by a company owner and a senior developer. Although it was a frontend position, the test was mostly algorithms and web basics. I started calm, but got lost explaining simple algorithms — that drained my confidence. I didn’t give up and asked for help, but eventually ran out of time. After the call I felt like I’d ruined my only chance.

As impostor syndrome kicked in, I decided to learn from mistakes. Action items:

1. Practice algorithms like reverse, sort, map, filter, etc. We rely too much on methods without knowing how they work.
2. Think and maybe write more before speaking. I’m an “ideas on paper” person; I’ll write while formulating an idea, even during interviews.
3. Be more objective when answering. Under pressure I took too long and diverged, losing precious time.

That was my experience — hope it helps you perform better at code interviews.
