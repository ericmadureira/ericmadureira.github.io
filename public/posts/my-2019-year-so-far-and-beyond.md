2019 is by far the best year of my life. Since I left my home city to live and work in Campinas I’ve learned a lot about programming and about myself.

I’m no longer afraid of Git, JavaScript, React and Node, and I’m much more confident to land any position, ready to try my very best. Each new challenge has been harder, but I overcame them — even when I felt unable at first.

For 2020 I hope to soar even higher: write more, practice more and help others do the same by mentoring, leading and improving with their feedback. Being a software dev is not easy, but all you have to do is steadily improve — even if it’s not fast.
