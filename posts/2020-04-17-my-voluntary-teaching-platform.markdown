As an effort to engage myself more with voluntary work and practice even more JS, React, Node and all the new stuff, I've started an open source voluntary teaching platform.

By open source I mean people can take this project, copy it, make money out of it, anything, as long as people get to help each other. And by voluntary teaching I mean this platform must provide ways for voluntaries, who already teach something or not, to organize their studentes and classes.

To achieve that the first features will be:
1. register of teachers and students,
2. creation and managemente of classes (a bunch of students, their teacher and a subject),
3. classes pages to gather info about the teacher's initiave,
4. a discover page where top and new projects get to be shown.

Even though I've accumulated experience with the said tech stack, implementing it with Graphql and Apollo has been my main challenge. But hey, it's about helping people and on top of that improving my skills, it's a huge WIN - WIN :)

So, if anyone got interested just drop by the [**repository**](https://github.com/ericmadureira/voluntariado-facil) and be part of it, or at least share with some friends :)
