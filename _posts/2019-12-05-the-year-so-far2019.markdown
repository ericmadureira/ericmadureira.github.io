title: My 2019 year so far (and beyond)

2019 is being by far the best year of my life. Ever since I left my home city to live and work in Campinas I’ve learned a lot about programming and about myself.

Not only I’m not afraid of Git, Javascript, React and Node anymore but also I’m much more confident to land on any job position, ready to at least try my very best in all situations. Every new challenge has been harder and harder but I was able to overcome them, even though I felt unable to do it at first.

For 2020 I hope to soar even higher in my career by writing more, practicing more and helping other people reach the same by mentoring them, leading them and improving with their feedback. Being a software developer is not easy but all you have to do is steadily improve even if it’s not that fast.
