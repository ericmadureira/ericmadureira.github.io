I took my first technical interview yesterday and even not feeling very confident about the result, for me it was a good experience. I said first technical interview because for my first and current job as a software developer there was no extensive test of skills, just a fast review of my portfolio.

Back on the topic. I had 1 hour to solve about 10 questions while being watched and assisted by one of the company's owners and a senior developer. Even though it was a test for a frontend position, the test was most related to algorithms and web basics. At first I wasn't too nervous, I just wanted to show my best and argue as most as possible, but then I got a  bit lost explaining very simple algorithms and that drained a bit of my confidence. I didn't give up, still tried to elaborate on my solutions and asked for help but gradually got more upset about the situation and couldn't answer all the questions in time. After thanking the interviewers and ending the call I felt pretty bad, like have ruined my only chance. As the impostor's syndrome kicked in I tried to raise my head, trying to not get in a bad mood and decided that I will learn from my mistakes.

I made a list of actions to improve myself based on what I learned from this experience:

1. To practice more algorithms like reverse, sort, map, filter, etc. I think everybody relies too much on certain methods without knowing how they work and how to replicate them.
2. To think and maybe write more about what I want to say, before saying it. I'm a "ideas on the paper" person so I'll write more while theorizing an idea, even during an interview, since it makes easier for me to understand a problem and build it's solution.
3. To be more objective whenanswering questions. As I was feeling more and more pressured by the simple questions I was taking so long to answer, I deviated a lot and it made me lose even more precious time to finish the test.

I hope this post can help you perform better at technical interviews.
