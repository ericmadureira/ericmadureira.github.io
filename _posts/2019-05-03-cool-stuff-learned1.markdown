I've changed the post format to include a larger period of time because there isn't much knowledge worth sharing every week. That being said, in the past weeks I've worked with Rails, Docker and a little bit of React, mostly to develop my skill with the front-end client + API architecture and reinforce some deficiencies I noted on previous code interviews.

* Rails
	* **rails new project_name --api**: This is the command to generate a new rails application adapted to be an API. I still don't feel comfortable to list all the benefits of a rails api but I'm sure it involves the reasons rails is known for, quoting the official documentation: a set of defaults that allows developers to get up and running quickly, without having to make a lot of trivial decisions. It's even possible to enable API mode on an already existing application. Because of this and other reasons like familiarity, Rails is my choice to start learning more about APIs.

* Docker
	* **Basics**: I finally understood a bit of how Docker works and it's advantages, but more importantly I've been using it daily. You can easily create and distribute your software environment and it's dependencies in a lightweight package to be run in almost every platform. I know it can be used for deployment and much more but it's been awesome already to simply develop on my windows 10 machine (yes, there are other good options) and make my personal projects more accessible.

* React Native
	* **Introduction**: Another technology that impressed me a lot, given how easy it was to create a mobile app just using React and the beginner-friendly tool named Expo. I'm excited to learn more and integrate it in my fullstack tool belt along with Rails and React itself. Here goes the link to my first app on github, which should be improved in the next weeks: [My first React-Native App](https://github.com/ericmadureira/gym-app).

That's all about the past few weeks and it'll be June very soon but I feel like I've learned a lot already. Good studies for everyone! :)
