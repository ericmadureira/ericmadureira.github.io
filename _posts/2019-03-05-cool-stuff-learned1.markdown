I've changed the post format to include a larger period of time because there isn't much knowledge worth sharing every week. That being said, I worked with Rails, Docker and a little bit of React, mostly to develop my skill with the front-end client + API architecture and reinforce some deficiencies I noted on previous code interviews.

* Rails
	* **rails new project_name --api**: This is the command to generate a new rails application adapted to be an API. I don't feel comfortable yet to list all the pros rails apis bring to the table but it surely involves everything rails is known for, quoting the official doc: a set of defaults that allows developers to get up and running quickly, without having to make a lot of trivial decisions. It's even possible to enable API mode on an existing application. Because of that and other reasons like familiarity, Rails is my choice to start learning more about APIs.

* Docker
	* **Basics**: I finally understood a bit of how Docker works and it's advantages, but more importantly I could use it daily. You can easily create and distribute your software environment and it's dependencies in a lightweight package to be run almost everywhere. I know it can be used for deployment as well but it's been awesome already to simply develop on my windows 10 machine (yes, there are other good options) and make my projects more accessible.

* React Native
	* **Introduction**: Another technology that impressed me, given how easy it was to create a mobile app just using React and the noob-friendly tool named Expo. I look foward to learn more and integrate it in fullstack tool belt along with Rails and React itself. Here goes the link to my first app on github, which will be improved in the following days: [My first React-Native App](https://github.com/ericmadureira/gym-app).
