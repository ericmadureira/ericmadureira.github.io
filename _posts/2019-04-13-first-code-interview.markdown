I took my first code interview yesterday and even not feeling a 100% confident about the result, for me it was a good experience. I said first code interview because for my first and current job as a software developer there was no extensive test of skills, just a fast review of my portfolio.

I had 1 hour to solve about 7 questions while being watched and assisted by one of the company's owners and a senior developer. Even though it was a test for a frontend position, the test was most related to algorithms and web basics. At first I wasn't too nervous, I just wanted to show my best and argue as most as possible, but then I got a bit lost explaining very simple algorithms and that drained a bit of my confidence. I didn't give up, still tried to elaborate on my solutions and asked for help but gradually got more upset about the situation and couldn't answer all the questions in time. After thanking the interviewers and ending the call I felt bad, like have ruined my only chance.

As the impostor's syndrome kicked in I raised my head, trying to not get in a bad mood and decided to learn from my mistakes. I made a list of actions to improve myself based on what I learned from this experience:

1. To practice more algorithms like reverse, sort, map, filter, etc. I think everybody relies too much on certain methods without knowing how they work and how to replicate them.
2. To think and maybe write more about what I want to say, before saying it. I'm a "ideas on the paper" person so I'll write more while formulating an idea, even during an interview, since it makes easier for me to understand a problem and come up with a solution.
3. To be more objective when answering questions. As I felt increasingly pressured by the simple questions I was taking so long to respond, I ended up diverting from the subject and that made me lose even more precious time to finish the test.

That was my experience and I hope this post can help you perform better at code interviews.
