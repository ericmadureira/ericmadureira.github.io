This is a review of Loiane Groner’s Learning JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms. I will not make a huge analysis about every chapter but I hope this post can help you find an understandable reference about data structures.

This was the first data structure book I have read and I think its an appropriate introduction to new programmers. I think it was a good decision to choose Javascript as the programming language for the book. The demand for that language is high and the environment is very easy to setup because it can be run in the console of most of the web browsers(if not all). Its very easy to start and keep practicing the algorithms discussed. The book covers most of the basics and a little bit more than what I’m used to see on data structure articles. You can even find sets, hashing and a few paragraphs about Algorithm Complexity. Each chapter describes the concepts behind the data structure, its pros, cons and at least one detailed example.

Now a little criticism: page-break sometimes makes it harder to read and to keep track of the code indentation. Also maybe you should read another book, besides this one, that takes as an example a language with pointers implementation, like C or C++. It may improve even more your comprehension about data structures because Javascript helps but is not enough for that.

I also want to point some of the parts that I enjoyed the most, either for solving certain doubts or for presenting me with a new concept:

variables scope, a true concern for those who want to master the Javascript;
truthy and falsy, a common source of misunderstanding;
linked lists vs conventional arrays, you’ve got to at least understand the differences;
decimal to binary converter using stacks, it reminded me of my first semester classes on computer science;
hashing and hash table explanation, a new way of arrange data;
graphs, which is interesting to see on this book because it wasn’t part of the data structure classes I had on my previous college and
different sorting algorithms and their efficiencies (also a small introduction to Big O notation).

The reading is worth it and I recommend it to anybody who is starting on programming or for those who miss a bit of computer science in their daily job/career.
Loiane and her writing partners did a great job and it makes me very proud since most of them are brazilian like me. ^^
