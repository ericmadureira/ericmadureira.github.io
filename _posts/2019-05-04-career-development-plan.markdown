Every step in a developer’s career presents different challenges. I felt lucky for being in the right place and with the minimum amount of knowledge when 3 years ago I did my first tech interview and got my first job. It’s been a nice experience, full of learning and overcoming, specially when my mentor left the company and I felt unprepared to deal with more responsabilities. Everything ocurred fine and now I feel more confident to leave behind the junior developer title and reach something above. To reach this goal I plan on:
a. Reading more books, like Jeff Sutherland’s Scrum Guide so I can learn from the best, work on my weaknesses and get ready to work on high performance teams;
b. Taking more job interviews so I can feel even more confident when talking and taking tests
c. And creating along this year a series of mvps to practice my code following the industry standards. Soon I’ll be posting more about how it developed.
