This is the result of the last 3 years working hard to improve but I feel the last 3 months were the most significant to reach this goal.</p>\n<p>In this process I learned that setting and accomplishing small goals daily is the best way to keep me motivated. I'm very grateful for all the support and learning from my family, my girlfriend, friends and everyone at Techmobil, where I had my first opportunity as a software developer and learned so much about profissionalism, ethics, responsibility, productivity and companionship.</p>\n<p>I'm leaving my hometown Ilh√©us to move to Campinas, 1700 km away from everything I know. I'm really excited to face this new challenge at a bigger company called ProFusion where I'm supposed to work with many different technologies and not only Ruby on Rails as I used to. I'm ready to improve as a person and a developer, and also help everyone around me to accomplish the same.</p>\n<p>More news soon! :)</p>","timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/moving-campinas-new-job/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2811507750","63159454"]}
